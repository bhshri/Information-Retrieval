## Preprocessing Text
Cleaning and preprocessing the text is a prerequisite for all the IR and NLP tasks. Cleaning text by removing tags and punctuations, stopword removal, stemming and lemmatization was performed on the text.

## TF-IDF
Representation of text in an important step in all the IR and NLP tasks. TF-IDF representation was implemented from scratch on a set of documents and comparison was done with the Sklearn implementation.

## Word2Vec Representation
Document Retrieval using SkipGram and CBOW word representation and evaluation using Precision, Recall and F1 score.

## LSI
Implementation of LSI on set of documents with the help of SVD and testing Retrieval of documents using cosine similarity measure.

## YASS Stemmer 
Stemming is implemented using agglomerative clustering using various distance measures for the strings.

## Query Expansion and Relevance feedback
Document retrieval using query was evaluated by performing query expansion(synonyms of query words) and relevance feedback(rocchio algorithm).

## Question Answering
Question answering using unsupervised approach using word2vec representation and evaluation using Exact Match and F1 score.

## Text Summarization
Extractive text summarization using Texrank and Lexrank and evaluation using ROGUE1 and ROGUE 2 score.

## Text Classification
Multiclass text classification using TF-IDF and word2vec representation using SVM.

## Text classification using Ensemble based approach
Multiclass text classification using Stacking and voting classifiers. Ensemble of Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and Random Forests.
